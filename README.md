# TITLE: Car Insurance Claims Prediction

### Problem Statement
The insurance claim is a basic problem in insurance companies. Insurance insurers always have a challenge to the growing of insurance claim loss. Because there is the occurrence of claim fraud and the volume of claim data increases in the insurance companies. As a result, it is difficult to classify the insured claim status during the claim review process. Therefore, the aims of the study was to build a machine learning model that classifies and make insurance claim status prediction in machine learning approach.

### Aim
To build a solution that should be able to predict if a Car Insurance Claim was made or not according to the provided dataset.

### Approach
The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. We will try out different machine learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

### Content
The columns are resembling practical world features. The outcome column indicates 1 if a customer has claimed his/her loan else 0. The data has 19 features from there 18 of them are corresponding logs which were taken by the company.
